# Neural Network in Python

This repository contains a Python implementation of a simple neural network. The neural network is implemented as a class and supports feedforward, backpropagation, training, and prediction functionalities. It allows users to create a neural network with customizable architecture (number of inputs, hidden nodes, and outputs) and train it using a specified number of epochs. The implementation includes activation functions (sigmoid and its derivative), weight and bias initialization, error calculation, and weight update. The neural network can be used to solve basic logic gate problems (such as OR, AND, XOR, and NOR gates) and predict outputs based on provided inputs. The repository also includes functionality to save and load trained weights and biases.

This neural network implementation serves as a starting point for understanding and experimenting with artificial neural networks using Python. It can be used for educational purposes or as a foundation for building more complex neural network models.
